# Deep Learning


This is a Python-based neural networks tool that predicts whether potential investments may be successful. The tool incorporates a binary classification model using a deep neural network.  The first step is to pre-process the data.  The second step is to use the model-fit-predict pattern and evaluate a binary classification model. Finally, the last step is to optimize the model by changing the inputs, such as number of nodes, layers or epochs.
