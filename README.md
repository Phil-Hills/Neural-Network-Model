# Deep Learning


Python-based neural networks tool that predicts success rate of investments.  Step One is to pre-process the data. Step 2 step is to use the model-fit-predict pattern and evaluate a binary classification model. Step three is to optimize the model by changing the inputs, such as number of nodes, layers or epochs.
